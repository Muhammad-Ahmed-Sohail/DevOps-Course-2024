### Basic DevOps Concepts
DevOps is a combination of development (Dev) and operations (Ops) aimed at unifying software development and IT operations. Its primary goal is to shorten the software development lifecycle and deliver high-quality software continuously. Key concepts include:
- Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD)
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- Monitoring and Logging
- Collaboration between development and operations teams

### Git and GitHub
Git is a version control system that tracks changes in code, making collaboration efficient and secure. GitHub is a platform that hosts Git repositories and provides tools for collaboration and code review. Key aspects include:
- Creating and managing repositories
- Branching and merging code
- Pull requests and code reviews

### Docker
Docker is a tool designed to create, deploy, and run applications in isolated environments called containers. It simplifies the deployment process, ensuring consistency across various environments. Main components include:
- Docker images and containers
- Docker Compose for multi-container applications
- Container orchestration with Kubernetes

### Cluster Deployment with Knative
Knative is an open-source Kubernetes-based platform to manage serverless workloads. It simplifies the deployment and scaling of containerized applications and offers features like:
- Autoscaling based on request traffic
- Event-driven architecture for serverless applications
- Serving and Eventing components for workload management

### Scaling with Kubernetes
Kubernetes is an open-source platform for managing containerized workloads. It automates scaling, deployment, and management of applications in containers. Scaling topics covered include:
- Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA)
- Cluster Autoscaling
- Manual and automated scaling options

### Building EKS Clusters on AWS with Terraform
EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) is Amazonâ€™s managed Kubernetes service. Terraform is used to create and manage infrastructure in code. In this section, topics covered include:
- Setting up EKS clusters with Terraform
- Defining infrastructure as code for scalable, repeatable setups
- Managing resources and dependencies in AWS

### Cluster Management with Minikube and Knative
Minikube is a lightweight Kubernetes tool for local development, while Knative extends Kubernetes for serverless applications. Key learnings include:
- Local cluster deployment with Minikube
- Serverless deployment and management with Knative
- Resource handling in a local development environment

### Enforcing Policies with Kyverno
Kyverno is a Kubernetes-native policy engine used for securing clusters by enforcing compliance policies. Covered topics include:
- Writing and applying policies to Kubernetes resources
- Validating, mutating, and generating resources based on policies
- Enforcing security and compliance standards in Kubernetes clusters

### Service Management with Istio
Istio is a service mesh that provides advanced service management for microservices. It helps manage traffic flows, secure services, and observe microservices' performance. Topics include:
- Installing and configuring Istio on Kubernetes
- Traffic management, including routing and load balancing
- Securing service communication with mTLS and monitoring services
