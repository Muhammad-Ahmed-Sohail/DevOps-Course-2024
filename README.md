### 📘 Basic DevOps Concepts
DevOps is a combination of development (Dev) and operations (Ops) aimed at unifying software development and IT operations. Its primary goal is to shorten the software development lifecycle and deliver high-quality software continuously. Key concepts include:
-  Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD)
-  Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
-  Monitoring and Logging
-  Collaboration between development and operations teams

### 🔧 Git and GitHub
Git is a version control system that tracks changes in code, making collaboration efficient and secure. GitHub is a platform that hosts Git repositories and provides tools for collaboration and code review. Key aspects include:
-  Creating and managing repositories
-  Branching and merging code
-  Pull requests and code reviews

### 🐳 Docker
Docker is a tool designed to create, deploy, and run applications in isolated environments called containers. It simplifies the deployment process, ensuring consistency across various environments. Main components include:
-  Docker images and containers
-  Docker Compose for multi-container applications
-  Container orchestration with Kubernetes

### ☁️ Cluster Deployment with Knative
Knative is an open-source Kubernetes-based platform to manage serverless workloads. It simplifies the deployment and scaling of containerized applications and offers features like:
-  Autoscaling based on request traffic
-  Event-driven architecture for serverless applications
-  Serving and Eventing components for workload management

### 📈 Scaling with Kubernetes
Kubernetes is an open-source platform for managing containerized workloads. It automates scaling, deployment, and management of applications in containers. Scaling topics covered include:
-  Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA)
-  Cluster Autoscaling
-  Manual and automated scaling options

### ⚙️ Building EKS Clusters on AWS with Terraform
EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) is Amazon’s managed Kubernetes service. Terraform is used to create and manage infrastructure in code. In this section, topics covered include:
-  Setting up EKS clusters with Terraform
-  Defining infrastructure as code for scalable, repeatable setups
-  Managing resources and dependencies in AWS

### 📦 Cluster Management with Minikube and Knative
Minikube is a lightweight Kubernetes tool for local development, while Knative extends Kubernetes for serverless applications. Key learnings include:
-  Local cluster deployment with Minikube
-  Serverless deployment and management with Knative
-  Resource handling in a local development environment

### 🔒 Enforcing Policies with Kyverno
Kyverno is a Kubernetes-native policy engine used for securing clusters by enforcing compliance policies. Covered topics include:
-  Writing and applying policies to Kubernetes resources
-  Validating, mutating, and generating resources based on policies
-  Enforcing security and compliance standards in Kubernetes clusters

### 🔗 Service Management with Istio
Istio is a service mesh that provides advanced service management for microservices. It helps manage traffic flows, secure services, and observe microservices' performance. Topics include:
-  Installing and configuring Istio on Kubernetes
-  Traffic management, including routing and load balancing
-  Securing service communication with mTLS and monitoring services
