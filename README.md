### Basic DevOps Concepts 💡
DevOps is a combination of development (Dev) and operations (Ops) aimed at unifying software development and IT operations. Its primary goal is to shorten the software development lifecycle and deliver high-quality software continuously.

### Git and GitHub 🐙
Git is a version control system that tracks changes in code, making collaboration efficient and secure. GitHub is a platform that hosts Git repositories and provides tools for collaboration and code review.

### Docker 🐳
Docker is a tool designed to create, deploy, and run applications in isolated environments called containers. It simplifies the deployment process, ensuring consistency across various environments.

### Cluster Deployment with Knative ☁️
Knative is an open-source Kubernetes-based platform to manage serverless workloads. It simplifies the deployment and scaling of containerized applications.

### Scaling with Kubernetes 📈
Kubernetes is an open-source platform for managing containerized workloads. It automates scaling, deployment, and management of applications in containers.

### Building EKS Clusters on AWS with Terraform 🛠️
EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) is Amazon’s managed Kubernetes service. Terraform is used to create and manage infrastructure in code.

### Cluster Management with Minikube and Knative 🔧
Minikube is a lightweight Kubernetes tool for local development, while Knative extends Kubernetes for serverless applications.

### Enforcing Policies with Kyverno 🛡️
Kyverno is a Kubernetes-native policy engine used for securing clusters by enforcing compliance policies.

### Service Management with Istio 🕸️
Istio is a service mesh that provides advanced service management for microservices.
